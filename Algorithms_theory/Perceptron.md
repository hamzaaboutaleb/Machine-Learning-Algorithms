The perceptron is type of neural network that performs binary classification that maps input features to an output decision , usually classifying data into one of two categories such as 0 or 1 . 
Perceptron consists of a single layer of input nodes that are fully connected to a layer of output nodes. It is particularly good at learning linearly separable patterns.  It utilizes a variation of artificial neurons called ****Threshold Logic Units (TLU)****, which were first introduced by McCulloch and Walter Pitts in the 1940s. This foundational model has played a crucial role in the development of more advanced neural networks and machine learning algorithms.

# notes : 
---
- many algorithms in machine learning optimize an objective function with respect to a set of desired model parameters that control how good the model explains the data
- Finding good model parameters can be phrased as an optimization problem. 
- A function is a quantitie that relates two quantities to each other , in machine learning these two quantities are typically inputs and targets .

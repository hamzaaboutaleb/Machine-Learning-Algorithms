### flexibility : 
---
the previous guidelines are guidelines , no more <br>
Feel free to show your personality or creative in adding or taking away slides .

### Designing PowerPoint 
---
keep things simple <br>
Use contrasts <br>
- Dark backgrounds - light wording
- Light background - dark wording <br>
Fewer words - use pictures , figures and tables to tell the story.

so you want the audience to listen to you and see what you have and not listen to you and real at the same time . 

### Practice , Practice , Practice : 
---
1. It is okay to write out a script of what you want to say , its NOT OKAY to read the script 
2. Use the mirror to practice your whole presentation 
3. its okay to make mistakes while presenting , breath and continue
4. it is a great strategy to pause , thik about what you will say and then say it , the audience is none the wiser 
<br>
Practice Make it perfect !
